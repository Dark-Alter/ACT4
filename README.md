TIC - ACT 4
Hello, ladies and gentlemen;
This repository contains my (and my group's) participation in a task given to us by a professor in our university;
The task was like this: "Create a website using what you have learned in HTML & CSS, in which you summerize what you have learned throughout the year in this field";
The CSS part was done by me;
Hope you like it and take inspiration from it;
